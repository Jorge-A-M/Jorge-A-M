## Welcome to My World 👋

I'm Jorge, a Computer Science student at the University of Illinois Chicago with experience primarily in data structures, object-oriented programming, and machine learning. I've completed several academic and personal projects, and even interned as an AI Toolkit Developer and Tester, evaluating the performance of several ML algorithms against different fairness metrics. 

I'm currently focusing on finishing my degree and growing as a programmer as much as possible!

I'm a competitive gamer in my free time and have played at a top level.
